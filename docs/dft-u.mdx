title: DFT+U calculation
---
import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';

We will calculate the density of states for NiO with and without including
Hubbard $U$. We will start from the example input file for NiO (check work
directory under OpenMX installation).

import nio_in from '!!raw-loader!/src/NiO/NiO.in';

<CodeBlock className="fortran" title="src/NiO/NiO.in">{nio_in}</CodeBlock>

Here we compare the density of states with and without considering electronic
correlation.
