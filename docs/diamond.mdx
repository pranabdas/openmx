import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';

We will run the bandstructure calculation from the OpenMX example file. Here is
the input file:

import diamond_in from '!!raw-loader!/src/diamond/diamond.in';

<CodeBlock className="fortran" title="src/diamond/diamond.in">{diamond_in}</CodeBlock>

We can run the calculation using mpirun or submit via job-script:
```bash
mpirun -np 12 openmx diamond.in > diamond.out
```

Next step is to extract bandstructure data from `diamond.Band` file:
```bash
bandgnu13 diamond.Band
```

Finally, we can plot the bandstructure using gnuplot or any plotting program of
your choice:
```bash
gnuplot diamond.GNUBAND
```

## Density of States (DOS)

```bash
DosMain diamond.Dos.val diamond.Dos.vec
```

It will ask few options interactively. Use of tetrahedron method is suitable.
The output file `diamond.DOS.Tetrahedron` will contain the energy, DOS and
integrated DOS columns.

While running the **DosMain** program, you can also choose PDOS for projected
density of states for each orbitals.
