import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';

Here we will calculate the bandstructure of silicon. First step is to perform
the scf calculation. Here is our input file:

import silicon_in from '!!raw-loader!/src/silicon/silicon.in';

<CodeBlock className="fortran" title="src/silicon/silicon.in">{silicon_in}</CodeBlock>

We can run the calculation using mpirun or submit via job-script:
```bash
mpirun -np 12 openmx silicon.in > silicon.out
```

While the calculation is running, you can monitor the convergence by:
```bash
grep "dUele" silicon.out | tail
```

Next step is to extract bandstructure data from `silicon.Band` file:
```bash
bandgnu13 silicon.Band
```

Finally, we can plot the bandstructure using gnuplot or any program of your
choice:
```bash
gnuplot silicon.GNUBAND
```
