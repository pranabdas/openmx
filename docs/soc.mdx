title: Spin Orbit Coupling
---

In order to perform fully relativistic calculation:

(A) Full relativistic effects can only be applied in non-collinear calculations.

```bash
scf.SpinPolarization        NC        # On|Off|NC
```

When the option `NC` is specified, wave functions are expressed by a two
component spinor, and initial spin orientation of each site should be provided:

```bash
<Atoms.SpeciesAndCoordinates           # Unit=Ang
    1  Mn    0.00000   0.00000   0.00000   8.0  5.0  45.0 0.0 45.0 0.0  1 on
    2  O     1.70000   0.00000   0.00000   3.0  3.0  45.0 0.0 45.0 0.0  1 on
Atoms.SpeciesAndCoordinates>
```

Col | Description
--- | -----------
1   | sequential serial number
2   | species name
3   | x-coordinate
4   | y-coordinate
5   | z-coordinate
6   | initial occupation for up spin
7   | initial occupation for down spin
8   | Euler angle, theta, of the magnetic field for spin magnetic moment
9   | Euler angle, phi, of the magnetic field for spin magnetic moment. Also,  the 8th and 9th are used to generate the initial non-collinear spin charge distribution
10  | the Euler angle, theta, of the magnetic field for orbital magnetic moment
11  | the Euler angle, phi, of the magnetic field for orbital magnetic moment
12  | switch for the constraint schemes specified by the keywords `scf.Constraint.NC.Spin` and `scf.NC.Zeeman.Orbital`. `1` means that the constraint is applied, and `0` no constraint.
13  | switch for enhancement of orbital polarization in the LDA+U method, `on` means that the enhancement is made, `off` means no enhancement.

(B) Use $j$-dependent pseudopotential, i.e., it incorporates full relativistic
correction.

(C) Turn on the soc flag:

```bash
scf.SpinOrbit.Coupling      on         # On|Off, default=off
```

## Bulk and surface bands for Bi<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub>

Here we compare the bulk and surface electronic structure of topological
insulating Bi<sub>2</sub>Se<sub>3</sub>. In both cases we consider noncollinear
magnetism with spin orbit coupling. In case of slab calculation 10 Å vacuum is
introduced among the layers.
